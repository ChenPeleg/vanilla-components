# GitHub Configuration

This directory contains GitHub-specific configuration files for the Vanilla Components project.

## Files

- **`copilot-instructions.md`** - GitHub Copilot instructions with both quick reference rules and comprehensive documentation covering patterns, conventions, and best practices for this vanilla web components project.

- **`workflows/`** - GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD, testing, and deployment.

## GitHub Copilot Integration

The copilot instruction file helps ensure that GitHub Copilot suggestions align with the project's conventions and patterns:

- Web component development using vanilla TypeScript
- Shadow DOM and Custom Elements API usage  
- TailwindCSS styling patterns
- File organization and import management
- Accessibility best practices
- Testing patterns with Playwright

These instructions improve code consistency and help developers (and AI assistants) follow the established patterns in the codebase.
